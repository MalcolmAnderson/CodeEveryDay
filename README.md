# CodeEveryDay

This directory is intended to be used as my basic workshop "note repository"

My daily TDD practice, my algorythm practice, my random tutorial practice.

If you are here, and not me, then thanks for stopping by.  
If you have any questions feel free to ping me at malcolm.b.anderson@gmail.com
